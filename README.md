# Wall-E_v2.2-beta

*Development Repository for the self-balancing-line-following bot workshop, implemented with ESP32*

## Guidelines

### General

1) Strict deadlines will be followed, since the tasks in general are not complicated. Failure to do so will result in elimination from the project after warnings.
2) The ones who will structure and compile the code will have the responsibility of making it easy-to-read and debug for the ones who will test it.
3) Try to maintain error logs in a file or screenshots for every stage of development and any genuine errors.

### Git

1) Each member will work only on his/her respective branch with name format as `member_name/feature`. The master branch will be used as the base for every branch.
2) `gitignore` files are mandatory. Compiler files such as .vscode and the build directory for ESP-IDF must not be pushed.
3) Maintain a brief README from the start of your work.
4) Comment your code while in the development stage itself.
5) Commit messages must be short and explain clearly what it does.
